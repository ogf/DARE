;; ### Introduction

;; Backend is responsible of implementing the functionality specified
;; by `es.uvigo.ei.sing.dare.domain.IBackend`. It stores and retrieves
;; domain objects to and from a MongoDB database.
;;
;; Besides, it uses DARE-workers client part to send the executions.

;; We have to transform the domain objects(Java classes instances)

;; object into a map using the built-in function `bean`. This gives us
;; a map with the properties of the domain object. We apply some
;; further transformations to this map, obtaining a map that can be
;; saved as a document for the proper collection.
