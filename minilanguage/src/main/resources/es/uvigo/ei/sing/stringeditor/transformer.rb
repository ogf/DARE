# ### Introduction

# An *aAUTOMATOR* Robot specifies steps for doing web scraping of a
# page or a set of pages. Each robot is built from several
# transformers connected in the shape of a graph. Each transformer
# type specifies some elemental operation to make. They are
# parametrized and combined to create a whole robot. This robot is
# specified in a XML format.
#
# Here we define a DSL that we call *minilanguage*. It eases the
# creation of *aAUTOMATOR* robots, so no longer is needed to create
# verbose XML files. Instead we can use a *minilanguage* string to
# define it.
#
# We can create a new *aAUTOMATOR* robot by feeding a minilanguage
# string to *Language*. *Language* class interprets it and creates a
# tree of *Transformer* objects. This *Transformer*'s tree resembles
# *aAUTOMATOR* XML format so the latter is easy to generate.
#
# *Language* interprets the *minilanguage* string by using the `eval`
# capabilities of Ruby. At *Language* class there are methods for
# creating transformers of each individual type. In order not to have
# to define manually a method for each type of Transformer, we
# generate them dynamically.

# We include java packages for generating the XML.
require 'java'

end

# ### *Transformer* as template for new subclasses

# We define methods to ease the definition of new *Transformer*
# subclasses. These methods are called when the class is being
# constructed and parametrize the behavior of the generated
# subclass. Each generated *Transformer* subclass receives the values
# for the parameters it requires when its constructor is
# called. *Transformer* class will be reopened.
class Transformer

# The `@variables` used inside of class methods(`self.method_name`)
# are local to each subclass. They are instance variables of each
# class metaclass.

# This method is intended to be used inside the body of subclasses
# from Transformer. It stores the value of the class as a symbol.
  def self.transformer_class value
    @transformer_class = value.to_sym
